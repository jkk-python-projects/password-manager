# Password Manager

This repository contains a Python practice code for a password manager.

## Description

The Password Manager is a Python script that allows users to securely store and manage their passwords. It provides a simple and convenient way to generate strong passwords, store them in an encrypted form, and retrieve them when needed.

The password manager uses the cryptography library to encrypt and decrypt passwords, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure. It also provides features like password generation, password strength checking, and the ability to search and retrieve stored passwords.

## Features

- Securely store and manage passwords.
- Generate strong and random passwords.
- Check password strength.
- Encrypt passwords for added security.
- Search and retrieve stored passwords.
- Simple and user-friendly command-line interface.

## Usage

To use the Password Manager, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/jkk-python-projects/password-manager.git

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
cd password-manager
Copy

3. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Copy

4. Run the Python script:
python main.py
pgsql

The script will present a menu of options for managing passwords. You can choose options like adding a new password, retrieving an existing password, generating a random password, and more.

5. Follow the prompts and provide the required information as requested by the script.

6. All passwords are stored in an encrypted file named "passwords.db" in the same directory as the script. The file is encrypted using a master password that you set during the initial setup.
